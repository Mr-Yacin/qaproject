# Admin Pages Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue
The `/admin/menus` and `/admin/users` pages were not redirecting to the login page when users logged out from another tab. These pages would stay visible instead of redirecting to `/admin/login`.

## Root Cause
These two admin pages were missing the `ClientAuthCheck` wrapper component that provides client-side session monitoring and automatic redirect functionality when sessions are lost.

## Solution
Added the `ClientAuthCheck` wrapper component to both pages to enable real-time session monitoring.

## Changes Made

### `/admin/menus/page.tsx`
- Added import: `import { ClientAuthCheck } from '@/components/admin/ClientAuthCheck';`
- Wrapped the page content with `<ClientAuthCheck>` component

### `/admin/users/page.tsx`
- Added import: `import { ClientAuthCheck } from '@/components/admin/ClientAuthCheck';`
- Wrapped the page content with `<ClientAuthCheck requiredRole={UserRole.ADMIN}>` component
- Used `requiredRole={UserRole.ADMIN}` since users page requires admin privileges

## Expected Behavior After Fix
✅ **Before**: Pages stayed visible after logout from another tab
✅ **After**: Pages automatically redirect to `/admin/login?callbackUrl=<current-page>` when session is lost

## Files Modified
- `src/app/admin/menus/page.tsx` - Added ClientAuthCheck wrapper
- `src/app/admin/users/page.tsx` - Added ClientAuthCheck wrapper with admin role requirement

## Consistency
This fix ensures that `/admin/menus` and `/admin/users` pages now have the same authentication behavior as other admin pages like:
- `/admin/media`
- `/admin/footer` 
- `/admin/cache`
- `/admin/audit-log`

## Testing
The pages should now:
1. Monitor session state in real-time
2. Automatically redirect to login when session expires
3. Preserve the current URL as callbackUrl for post-login redirect
4. Work consistently across browser tabs
