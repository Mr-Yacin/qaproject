# Requirements Document

## Introduction

After implementing significant changes to the admin interface including SEO enhancements, image/thumbnail support, and Prisma schema modifications, we need to ensure that all public API endpoints continue to function correctly. This verification process will validate that the API maintains backward compatibility, properly handles new fields, and continues to meet performance and security requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Endpoint Functionality Verification

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want all existing API endpoints to continue working correctly after admin interface changes, so that my integrations remain functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call GET /api/topics THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status with properly formatted topic data including new SEO fields
2. WHEN I call GET /api/topics with filtering parameters THEN the system SHALL apply filters correctly and return paginated results
3. WHEN I call GET /api/topics/[slug] THEN the system SHALL return the complete topic data including articles, questions, and FAQ items
4. WHEN I call POST /api/ingest with valid HMAC authentication THEN the system SHALL process the content and update the database correctly
5. WHEN I call POST /api/revalidate with valid authentication THEN the system SHALL clear the appropriate cache entries

### Requirement 2: New Field Integration Validation

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want new fields (SEO, thumbnails) to be properly included in API responses, so that I can utilize the enhanced content metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I retrieve topic data THEN the system SHALL include seoTitle, seoDescription, seoKeywords, and thumbnailUrl fields when present
2. WHEN I retrieve article data THEN the system SHALL include article-level SEO fields in the response
3. WHEN new fields are null or empty THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without errors
4. WHEN I ingest content with new fields THEN the system SHALL store and retrieve them correctly
5. IF new fields contain invalid data THEN the system SHALL validate and reject with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3: Database Schema Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure that Prisma schema changes don't break existing API functionality, so that the system remains stable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API queries the database THEN all existing queries SHALL execute successfully with the updated schema
2. WHEN new indexes are present THEN query performance SHALL be maintained or improved
3. WHEN cascading deletes are configured THEN related data SHALL be properly cleaned up
4. WHEN enum values are used THEN the system SHALL validate them correctly
5. IF database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 4: Authentication and Security Validation

**User Story:** As a security-conscious API consumer, I want authentication and security measures to remain intact after changes, so that my data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide valid HMAC signatures THEN the system SHALL authenticate requests successfully
2. WHEN I provide invalid or missing signatures THEN the system SHALL reject requests with 401 status
3. WHEN timestamps are outside the acceptable window THEN the system SHALL reject requests
4. WHEN request bodies are tampered with THEN signature validation SHALL fail appropriately
5. WHEN I attempt replay attacks THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent them

### Requirement 5: Performance and Caching Verification

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want API response times to remain acceptable after schema changes, so that my applications maintain good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make API requests THEN response times SHALL be under 500ms for simple queries
2. WHEN caching is enabled THEN subsequent identical requests SHALL be served from cache
3. WHEN cache is revalidated THEN new data SHALL be reflected in subsequent requests
4. WHEN pagination is used THEN large datasets SHALL be handled efficiently
5. IF database indexes are properly configured THEN complex queries SHALL execute within acceptable time limits

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent error handling and validation after changes, so that I can properly handle edge cases in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return 400 status with detailed error information
2. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 500 status with generic error messages
3. WHEN resources are not found THEN the system SHALL return 404 status with appropriate messages
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 status with retry information
5. WHEN malformed JSON is sent THEN the system SHALL return appropriate parsing error messages

### Requirement 7: Data Integrity and Consistency

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want data created through the admin interface to be properly accessible via the API, so that content changes are immediately reflected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is created in the admin interface THEN it SHALL be immediately available via the API
2. WHEN content is updated in the admin interface THEN changes SHALL be reflected in API responses
3. WHEN content is deleted in the admin interface THEN it SHALL no longer be accessible via the API
4. WHEN SEO fields are updated THEN they SHALL appear correctly in API responses
5. WHEN media files are uploaded THEN their URLs SHALL be properly included in content responses

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing API consumer, I want my current integrations to continue working without modification, so that I don't need to update my applications immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use existing API endpoints with previous parameter formats THEN they SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN I receive API responses THEN existing fields SHALL maintain their current structure and types
3. WHEN new fields are added THEN they SHALL not break existing response parsing
4. WHEN I use existing authentication methods THEN they SHALL continue to function
5. IF breaking changes are necessary THEN they SHALL be clearly documented and versioned
