# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The admin dashboard currently has critical layout and authentication issues that negatively impact user experience. The sidebar navigation is being rendered twice (duplicate sidebars), and the sidebar is visible even on the login page when users are not authenticated. This creates a confusing and unprofessional interface. This feature will fix these layout issues by properly managing sidebar rendering based on authentication state and route context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Duplicate Sidebar Rendering

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see only one sidebar navigation when I'm logged into the admin dashboard, so that the interface is clean and not confusing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated administrator views any admin page THEN the system SHALL display exactly one sidebar navigation
2. WHEN the AdminLayoutClient component renders THEN the system SHALL check if the current route requires sidebar rendering
3. WHEN the ClientAuthCheck component renders THEN the system SHALL not render its own sidebar if the layout already provides one
4. WHEN an administrator navigates between admin pages THEN the system SHALL maintain a single consistent sidebar
5. IF both AdminLayoutClient and ClientAuthCheck attempt to render sidebars THEN the system SHALL consolidate to a single sidebar instance
6. WHEN the page layout is rendered THEN the system SHALL ensure no duplicate navigation elements exist in the DOM
7. WHEN auditing the codebase THEN the system SHALL check all admin pages for duplicate sidebar rendering
8. WHEN multiple pages use ClientAuthCheck THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent behavior across all pages

### Requirement 2: Hide Sidebar on Login Page

**User Story:** As a user attempting to log in, I want to see only the login form without any admin navigation, so that I have a clean authentication experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to "/admin/login" THEN the system SHALL display only the login form without sidebar navigation
2. WHEN the AdminLayoutClient detects the login route THEN the system SHALL skip rendering the sidebar component
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user accesses the login page THEN the system SHALL show a minimal layout with just the login card
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect to the admin dashboard with full sidebar navigation
5. IF the session is null or undefined on the login page THEN the system SHALL not render any authenticated UI components
6. WHEN the login page renders THEN the system SHALL use a centered, card-based layout without admin chrome

### Requirement 3: Conditional Layout Rendering Based on Authentication

**User Story:** As a system, I want to render different layouts based on authentication state and current route, so that users see appropriate UI for their context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AdminLayoutClient receives a null session THEN the system SHALL render children without admin layout wrapper
2. WHEN the AdminLayoutClient receives a valid session AND the route is not "/admin/login" THEN the system SHALL render the full admin layout with sidebar
3. WHEN the current pathname is "/admin/login" THEN the system SHALL render children in a minimal layout
4. WHEN an authenticated user navigates to "/admin/login" THEN the system SHALL redirect them to "/admin" dashboard
5. IF the session status is "loading" THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator without layout chrome
6. WHEN the layout determines authentication state THEN the system SHALL make the decision server-side when possible for better performance
7. WHEN the route changes THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate whether to show the admin layout
8. IF the user logs out THEN the system SHALL immediately hide the admin layout and show the login page

### Requirement 4: Prevent Sidebar Re-rendering on Navigation

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the sidebar to remain stable when I navigate between admin pages, so that the interface feels smooth and responsive without unnecessary re-renders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator navigates from one admin page to another THEN the system SHALL not re-render or re-mount the sidebar component
2. WHEN the sidebar is rendered in the layout THEN the system SHALL persist across all admin route changes
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL only update the main content area, not the sidebar
4. WHEN the active menu item changes THEN the system SHALL update only the styling, not re-render the entire sidebar
5. IF the sidebar state (mobile open/closed) is set THEN the system SHALL maintain that state during navigation
6. WHEN using Next.js App Router THEN the system SHALL leverage layout persistence to prevent sidebar re-renders
7. WHEN the user session remains valid THEN the system SHALL not re-fetch or re-render the sidebar user profile section
8. IF performance profiling is done THEN the system SHALL show the sidebar component is not unmounting and remounting on navigation

### Requirement 5: Clean Up Redundant Layout Components

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single source of truth for admin layout rendering, so that the codebase is maintainable and bug-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ClientAuthCheck component is used THEN the system SHALL not duplicate layout functionality from AdminLayoutClient
2. WHEN a page needs authentication checking THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated auth check without rendering layout
3. WHEN the AdminLayoutClient is the layout wrapper THEN the system SHALL handle all layout rendering responsibilities
4. IF a component needs both auth checking and layout THEN the system SHALL use the layout component which includes auth logic
5. WHEN refactoring layout components THEN the system SHALL ensure no breaking changes to existing admin pages
6. WHEN the codebase is reviewed THEN the system SHALL have clear separation between auth checking and layout rendering
7. IF ClientAuthCheck is removed or refactored THEN the system SHALL update all pages that currently use it
8. WHEN layout logic is centralized THEN the system SHALL document the proper usage pattern for future development
9. WHEN searching the codebase for ClientAuthCheck usage THEN the system SHALL identify and update all instances
10. WHEN all admin pages are reviewed THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent layout and auth patterns across the entire admin section
