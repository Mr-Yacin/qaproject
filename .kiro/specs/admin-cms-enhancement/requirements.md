# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing admin panel to provide a comprehensive Content Management System (CMS) that allows administrators to manage not only topics but also site-wide settings, custom pages, navigation menus, and footer content. The current admin panel only supports basic topic management with limited CRUD operations. This enhancement will transform it into a full-featured CMS that gives administrators complete control over the frontend appearance and content.
