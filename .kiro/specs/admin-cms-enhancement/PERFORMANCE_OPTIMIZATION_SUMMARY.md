This document summarizes the performance optimizations implemented for the admin CMS enhancement project.

## Overview

Task 19 focused on optimizing database queries, frontend performance, and file uploads to improve the overall performance and user experience of the admin CMS.

## 19.1 Database Query Optimizations

### Added Database Indexes

Enhanced the Prisma schema with strategic indexes to improve query performance:

**Topic Model:**
- Added `createdAt` index for sorting
- Added `updatedAt` index for sorting
- Added composite `locale, updatedAt` index for filtered sorting

**Page Model:**
- Added `updatedAt` index for sorting
- Added composite `status, updatedAt` index for filtered sorting

**Media Model:**
- Added `uploadedBy` index for user-specific queries
- Added composite `mimeType, createdAt` index for filtered sorting

**User Model:**
- Added `isActive` index for filtering active users
- Added composite `role, isActive` index for role-based filtering

**AuditLog Model:**
- Added `action` index for filtering by action type
- Added composite `userId, createdAt` index for user activity queries
- Added composite `entityType, createdAt` index for entity-specific queries
- Added composite `action, createdAt` index for action-specific queries

### Cursor-Based Pagination

Created optimized repository classes with cursor-based pagination:

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/repositories/optimized-content.repository.ts`
- `src/lib/repositories/optimized-audit.repository.ts`

**OptimizedContentRepository:**
- `findTopicsMinimal()` - Fetches only essential fields for list views
- `findTopicBySlugOptimized()` - Conditionally includes content fields
- `findTopicsByIds()` - Batch fetches with eager loading to avoid N+1 queries

**OptimizedAuditRepository:**
- `findManyMinimal()` - Excludes large fields like details and userAgent for list views

**OptimizedMediaRepository:**
- `findManyMinimal()` - Fetches only thumbnail data for grid views
- `getStatistics()` - Uses aggregation for efficient statistics

### Query Optimization Utilities

- `useLazyLoad()` - Lazy loads components when visible

**Benefits:**
- Efficient visibility detection
- Enables lazy loading patterns
- Improves performance for long pages

### Performance Utilities

Created performance monitoring utilities in `src/lib/utils/performance.ts`:

**Functions:**
- `measurePerformance()` - Measures function execution time
- `throttle()` - Limits function execution frequency
- `debounce()` - Delays function execution
- `getConnectionSpeed()` - Detects user's connection speed
