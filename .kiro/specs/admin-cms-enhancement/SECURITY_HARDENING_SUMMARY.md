# Security Hardening Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the security hardening measures implemented for the admin CMS enhancement feature. All three sub-tasks have been completed successfully.

## Task 16.1: HTML Sanitization ✅

### Implementation

1. **DOMPurify Integration**
   - Already implemented in `CustomPage.tsx`
   - Added to `ArticleContent.tsx` component
   - Added to `FAQAccordion.tsx` component

2. **Sanitization Configuration**
   - Allowed tags: h1-h6, p, br, strong, em, u, s, a, img, ul, ol, li, blockquote, code, pre, table elements, div, span
   - Allowed attributes: href, target, rel, src, alt, title, width, height, class, loading, decoding
   - URI validation using regex to prevent malicious URLs

3. **CSP Headers**
   - Added Content Security Policy headers in `middleware.ts`
   - Configured directives:
     - `default-src 'self'`
     - `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'` (required for TipTap editor)
     - `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` (required for Tailwind)
     - `img-src 'self' data: https: blob:`
     - `object-src 'none'`
     - `frame-ancestors 'none'`
     - `upgrade-insecure-requests`

4. **Additional Security Headers**
   - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (admin routes) / `SAMEORIGIN` (public routes)
   - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
   - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
   - `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`

### Files Modified
- `middleware.ts` - Added CSP and security headers
- `src/components/ui/article-content.tsx` - Added DOMPurify sanitization
- `src/components/public/FAQAccordion.tsx` - Added DOMPurify sanitization

### Requirements Satisfied
- Requirement 3.9: HTML sanitization for XSS protection

---

## Task 16.2: File Upload Security ✅

### Implementation

1. **File Signature Validation**
   - Implemented magic number validation to verify actual file content
   - Validates that file content matches declared MIME type
   - Prevents malicious files disguised with fake extensions

2. **Enhanced Filename Generation**
   - Cryptographically secure random filenames using `crypto.randomBytes(16)`
   - Path traversal prevention using `path.basename()`
   - Extension validation against whitelist
   - Timestamp prefix for uniqueness

3. **Path Traversal Protection**
   - Resolved path validation to ensure files stay within upload directory
   - Checks that resolved path starts with upload directory path

4. **File Validation**
   - Server-side MIME type validation
   - File size limits (10MB for media, 5MB for logos)
   - Empty file detection
   - Allowed file types: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, PDF

5. **File Signatures Implemented**
   ```typescript
   'image/jpeg': [[0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF]]
   'image/png': [[0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x0A]]
   'image/gif': [[0x47, 0x49, 0x46, 0x38, 0x37, 0x61], [0x47, 0x49, 0x46, 0x38, 0x39, 0x61]]
   'image/webp': [[0x52, 0x49, 0x46, 0x46]]
   'application/pdf': [[0x25, 0x50, 0x44, 0x46]]
   ```

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/services/media.service.ts` - Enhanced file validation and security
- `src/app/api/admin/settings/logo/route.ts` - Added file signature validation and secure filename generation

### Requirements Satisfied
- Requirement 6.2: File upload validation
- Requirement 6.7: File upload security

---

## Task 16.3: Rate Limiting ✅

### Implementation

1. **Rate Limiting Middleware**
   - Created `src/lib/middleware/rate-limit.middleware.ts`
   - Implements token bucket algorithm
   - In-memory store with automatic cleanup
   - Configurable rate limits per endpoint type

2. **Rate Limit Configurations**
   ```typescript
   AUTH: 5 requests per 15 minutes
   UPLOAD: 10 requests per minute
   API: 100 requests per minute
   STRICT: 3 requests per 5 minutes
   ```

3. **Client Identification**
   - Uses IP address from headers (x-forwarded-for, x-real-ip, cf-connecting-ip)
   - Fallback to 'unknown' if no IP available

4. **Applied to Endpoints**
   - Authentication: Email-based rate limiting in `src/lib/auth.ts`
   - Media upload: IP-based rate limiting in `src/app/api/admin/media/upload/route.ts`
   - Logo upload: IP-based rate limiting in `src/app/api/admin/settings/logo/route.ts`

5. **Error Handling**
   - Returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
   - Includes `Retry-After` header with seconds until next request allowed
   - Integrated with centralized error handler

6. **Memory Management**
   - Automatic cleanup of old entries every hour
   - Prevents memory leaks from abandoned rate limit entries

### Files Created
- `src/lib/middleware/rate-limit.middleware.ts` - Rate limiting implementation

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Added rate limiting to authentication
- `src/app/api/admin/media/upload/route.ts` - Added rate limiting to media uploads
- `src/app/api/admin/settings/logo/route.ts` - Added rate limiting to logo uploads
- `src/lib/errors/error-handler.ts` - Added rate limit error handling

### Requirements Satisfied
- Requirement 7.2: Rate limiting for authentication and file upload endpoints

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security (validation, sanitization, rate limiting)
- Server-side validation in addition to client-side
- File content verification beyond extension checking

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Rate limits prevent abuse
- File type restrictions limit attack surface
- CSP headers restrict resource loading

### Input Validation
- All user inputs sanitized before rendering
- File uploads validated at multiple levels
- MIME type verification against actual content

### Error Handling
- Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Retry-After headers for rate limiting

---

## Testing Recommendations

### HTML Sanitization Testing
1. Test with malicious script tags
2. Test with event handlers (onclick, onerror)
3. Test with data URIs
4. Test with javascript: protocol URLs

### File Upload Security Testing
1. Test uploading files with fake extensions
2. Test path traversal attempts (../../etc/passwd)
3. Test oversized files
4. Test empty files
5. Test files with malicious content

### Rate Limiting Testing
1. Test exceeding rate limits
2. Verify Retry-After headers
3. Test rate limit reset after window expires
4. Test concurrent requests from same IP

---

## Production Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- Consider using Redis for distributed rate limiting in multi-instance deployments
- Monitor rate limit hits to detect potential attacks
- Adjust rate limits based on actual usage patterns

### CSP Headers
- Monitor CSP violations using report-uri directive
- Gradually tighten CSP policy as needed
- Test thoroughly with all admin features

### File Upload
- Consider virus scanning for uploaded files
- Implement file quarantine for suspicious uploads
- Monitor upload patterns for abuse

### Monitoring
- Log rate limit violations
- Track authentication failures
- Monitor file upload patterns
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity

## Compliance

This implementation helps satisfy common security compliance requirements:

- **OWASP Top 10**
  - A03:2021 - Injection (XSS prevention via sanitization)
  - A04:2021 - Insecure Design (rate limiting, validation)
  - A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration (CSP headers)

- **CWE**
  - CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  - CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
  - CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

---

## Conclusion

All security hardening tasks have been successfully implemented with comprehensive protection against:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- Malicious file uploads
- Path traversal attacks
- Brute force attacks
- Resource exhaustion

The implementation follows security best practices and provides multiple layers of defense to protect the application and its users.
