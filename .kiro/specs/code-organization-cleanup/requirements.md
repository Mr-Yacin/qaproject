# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for reorganizing and cleaning up the project structure, specifically focusing on consolidating scattered documentation files, test results, and test scripts into a more maintainable and logical folder structure. The current project has documentation and test-related files spread across multiple locations (root directory, `docs/`, `test-results/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`), making it difficult to navigate and maintain.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Consolidate Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all documentation organized in a clear hierarchy, so that I can quickly find relevant information without searching through multiple folders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation exists in multiple locations THEN it SHALL be organized into a logical folder structure under `docs/`
2. WHEN documentation covers similar topics THEN it SHALL be grouped together in appropriate subdirectories
3. WHEN documentation files are moved THEN any references to them in other files SHALL be updated
4. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN the root directory SHALL only contain essential configuration files and a main README

### Requirement 2: Organize Test-Related Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test scripts, test results, and test documentation organized separately, so that I can distinguish between actual tests, test utilities, and test reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test scripts exist in `scripts/` THEN they SHALL be categorized by purpose (e.g., verification, testing, utilities)
2. WHEN test results exist THEN they SHALL be organized in a dedicated location separate from test code
3. WHEN test documentation exists THEN it SHALL be placed with relevant test files or in a test documentation folder
4. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN the distinction between test code, test scripts, and test results SHALL be clear

### Requirement 3: Create Clear Folder Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-defined folder structure with clear naming conventions, so that I know where to place new files and where to find existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the new structure THEN it SHALL follow industry best practices for project organization
2. WHEN folders are created THEN they SHALL have descriptive names that clearly indicate their purpose
3. WHEN the structure is complete THEN it SHALL include README files in key directories explaining their purpose
4. WHEN new documentation or tests are added THEN developers SHALL easily understand where they belong

### Requirement 4: Maintain Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing scripts and workflows to continue working after reorganization, so that I don't break any automation or CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are moved THEN any scripts that reference them SHALL be updated
2. WHEN npm scripts exist THEN they SHALL be updated to reflect new file locations
3. WHEN Docker or CI/CD configurations reference files THEN they SHALL be updated accordingly
4. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work without errors

### Requirement 5: Remove Redundant Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want redundant or outdated files removed, so that the project remains clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate documentation exists THEN it SHALL be consolidated into a single source of truth
2. WHEN outdated test results exist THEN they SHALL be archived or removed
3. WHEN temporary or obsolete files exist THEN they SHALL be removed
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN only necessary files SHALL remain in the project
