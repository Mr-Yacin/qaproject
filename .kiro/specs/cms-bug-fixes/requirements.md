# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical bugs in the CMS application identified through testing. The issues include admin middleware authentication problems, frontend page errors on `/topics` and `/search`, and the need for test data to facilitate proper testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Admin Middleware Authentication

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want unauthenticated users to be properly blocked from accessing admin routes, so that the application is secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access any `/admin/*` route THEN the system SHALL redirect them to `/admin/login`
2. WHEN a user accesses `/admin/login` THEN the system SHALL NOT redirect them (no redirect loop)
3. WHEN the middleware checks authentication THEN it SHALL properly validate the NextAuth session token
4. WHEN running in Docker/production mode THEN the middleware SHALL function identically to development mode
5. WHEN an authenticated user accesses admin routes THEN they SHALL be allowed through without redirect
6. IF the middleware fails to load or execute THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2: Fix Topics Listing Page (/topics)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the topics listing page without errors, so that I can browse available topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/topics` THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code
2. WHEN the topics page loads THEN it SHALL display all published topics in a grid layout
3. WHEN there are no topics available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and display a user-friendly error message
5. WHEN topics are fetched THEN the system SHALL include all necessary related data (articles, FAQs, tags)
6. IF the page encounters a 500 error THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging

### Requirement 3: Fix Search Page (/search)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for topics without encountering errors, so that I can find relevant content quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/search` THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code
2. WHEN a user enters a search query THEN the system SHALL return relevant results
3. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL display "No results found" message
4. WHEN the search query is empty THEN the system SHALL display a prompt to enter search terms
5. WHEN search API calls fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
6. WHEN search results are displayed THEN they SHALL include topic title, description, and link

### Requirement 4: Create Test Data Seeder

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate fake test data easily, so that I can test the application with realistic content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the seed script is executed THEN it SHALL create at least 20 test topics with varied content
2. WHEN topics are created THEN each SHALL include:
   - A unique slug
   - A title
   - A main question
   - An article with content (published and draft statuses)
   - At least 3 FAQ items
   - 2-4 tags
   - A locale (en, es, fr)
3. WHEN the seed script runs THEN it SHALL clear existing test data first (optional flag)
4. WHEN the seed completes THEN it SHALL output a summary of created records
5. WHEN the seed script encounters errors THEN it SHALL log them and continue with remaining data
6. WHEN test data is created THEN it SHALL be realistic and varied enough for comprehensive testing

### Requirement 5: Fix Date Serialization in Topic Pages

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view topic detail pages without errors, so that I can read the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a topic page is rendered THEN date fields SHALL be properly serialized from the database
2. WHEN calling toISOString() on date fields THEN it SHALL work without errors
3. WHEN topic data is fetched from the API THEN dates SHALL be converted to Date objects
4. WHEN SEO metadata is generated THEN date fields SHALL be properly formatted
5. IF date conversion fails THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully with fallback values

### Requirement 6: Fix TipTap Editor SSR Hydration

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to create and edit topics without hydration errors, so that I can manage content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the topic editor loads THEN it SHALL NOT show SSR hydration mismatch errors
2. WHEN TipTap editor is initialized THEN it SHALL have `immediatelyRender` set to `false`
3. WHEN creating a new topic THEN the editor SHALL render correctly
4. WHEN editing an existing topic THEN the editor SHALL load the content without errors
5. WHEN saving topic content THEN it SHALL persist correctly to the database

### Requirement 7: Verify All Fixes

**User Story:** As a QA tester, I want to verify all fixes work correctly, so that I can confirm the application is ready for deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all fixes are implemented THEN the automated test suite SHALL pass with 100% success rate
2. WHEN manual testing is performed THEN all identified issues SHALL be resolved
3. WHEN the Docker container is tested THEN middleware SHALL properly block unauthenticated access
4. WHEN `/topics` page is accessed THEN it SHALL load without 500 errors
5. WHEN `/search` page is accessed THEN it SHALL function correctly
6. WHEN test data exists THEN all pages SHALL display content properly
7. WHEN admin topic editor is accessed THEN it SHALL work without errors
8. WHEN viewing topic detail pages THEN dates SHALL display correctly
