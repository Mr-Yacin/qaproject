# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive Content Management System (CMS) frontend to the existing Q&A Article FAQ API. The CMS will provide a WordPress-like experience for content creators and administrators to manage topics, articles, questions, and FAQ items through an intuitive web interface. The system will be built with modern design principles, full mobile responsiveness, and SEO optimization to ensure content is discoverable and accessible across all devices.

The CMS will integrate with the **existing API backend** (GET /api/topics, GET /api/topics/[slug], POST /api/ingest, POST /api/revalidate) and provide both public-facing pages for end users and an admin dashboard for content management. The admin dashboard will use the existing /api/ingest endpoint to create and update content, and the public pages will consume data from the existing GET endpoints. It will leverage Next.js 14+ App Router for optimal performance, server-side rendering for SEO, and a modern component-based architecture.
